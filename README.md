# Stepwise Schema-Guided Prompting Framework with Parameter Efficient Instruction Tuning for Multimedia Event Extraction

Supplementary appendices for further implementatio details and training code of model SSGPF. The paper of SSGPF model has been accepted by IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2025, entitled "Stepwise Schema-Guided Prompting Framework with Parameter Efficient Instruction Tuning for Multimedia Event Extraction".

We are currently organizing the source code, and we will release the model's training code soon after the paper is officially published.
